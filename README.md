This repo was created to store the codes used to create the results shown in the paper on the application of transfer learning to forecasting models of arboviral diseases. 

This study is an updated version of this work (available in pre-print): https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.03.20020164v1.full.pdf

In this work, we applied the transfer learning technique to predict the chikungunya cases using a model trained to predict the dengue cases. We applied this methodology to four Brazilian cities: 

* Recife - PE;
* Jo√£o Pessoa - PB; 
* Rio de Janeiro - RJ;
* Fortaleza - CE. 

Our repo is organized as follows:

* In the `data` folder, we have `.csv` tables with the data used to train and apply the models;

* In the `notebooks` folder, we have jupyter notebooks with the results of our analysis for each city. The notebooks are organized by folders: 

- `training`: In this folder we have the notebooks used to train the models. Also, there is a comparation of the error in train and validation datasets for the same model using the MSLE loss function and the custom MSLE loss function. 

- `transfer`: In this folder we have the notebooks used to apply the transfer learning techinique in the models. 

- `evaluation`: In this folder we have the notebooks used to compare the performance of the 3 kind of models trained: Bi-LSTM, transfer learning using Bi-LSTM and PGBM. 

- `create_figures`: In this notebook we have the code used to generate the figures shown in the article. 

* In the `plots` folder, we saved the figures;
* In the `predictions` folder, we save the predictions of the modes in `.pkl` files; 
* In the `saved_models` folder, we save the models trained. 
* In the `lstm.py` file, we have the definition of the functions used to apply the neural networks models used. 
* In the `pgbm_model.py` file, we have the definition of the functions used to apply the probabilistic grandient boosting tree models. 
* In the `plots_lstm.py` file, we have the definition of the functions used to plot the results of the neural networks models used. 
* In the `plots_pgbm.py` file, we have the definition of the functions used to plot the results of the gradient boosting tree models. 
In the `preprocessing.py` file, we have the definition of the functions use to process the data saved in the `data` folder and transform it in the format accepted by the models in `lstm.py` and `pgbm_model.py`.
